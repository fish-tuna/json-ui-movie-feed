React JSON feed app created in a day.

Architectural structure choices- I decided to make a one-page app because I didn't feel like doing routing.

Possible improvements- the only way to get back to the homescreen is an onclick refresh browser function bound to the header anchor text "Popular Titles". In order to switch this to conditional component display I'd have to refactor the components to avoid reverse-dataflow (child to parent). Sign-up button needs hover and click CSS because I removed the button border.

What I would do differently if I spent more time on this project- possibly refactor/clean/double-check CSS. I really like the JSON feed display, I wouldn't mind expanding that into different things besides movies and tv shows. That's a bit out of the scope/purpose of this project, though.
